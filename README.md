Personal website built in Bootstrap 4

Featuring the Japanese translation I added readable by clicking this button: 日本語

Japanese translation might have a lot of errors because I'm still a beginner

And this template is entirely built by me, Emmanuel Pangan

A custom website that doesn't need more plugins outside of Bootstrap

Pretty responsive too for all aspect ratios, including phones and PCs, tested with Chrome's Dev Tools

You can also copy/modify the template if you want to, no need for credits
